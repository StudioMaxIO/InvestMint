A Mintable Fundraising Token for No-Loss Investments

A fundraising token with automatic price adjustment and built-in in liquidity pool / exchange.

Token holders are incentivized to hold onto their tokens and benefit when others exchange (burn) their tokens. This makes a great situation for a fundraising situation where the issuer of the coin may initially purchase a few blocks, then after investors mint some tokens, the issuer burns some of their tokens to cover startup expenses. During this time investors hold their tokens until the value is appropriate for their exchange.

Value of the tokens increases whenever new blocks are purchased or when the liquidity pool is increased. One major incentive for investors in a fundraising scenario would be for the issuer to promise to return some percentage of profits back into the liquidity pool, thus providing an increase in value.

As tokens are sold, as long as at least 1 token exists, value of all tokens will never decrease, regardless of the number being minted or burned.
